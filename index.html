      <h4 class="mt-4">Overview</h4>


      <p width="80%"><img width="20%" alt="My Image" src="var_link_schema.png" /><strong>TODO: not sure about this starting paragraph.</strong><br>Social science literature often use and reference survey data. 
        While a survey dataset that is used in a scientific publication is typically referenced explicitly in-text using a bibliographic citation (e.g., Author et al.), 
        individual survey items or questions, also called <i>survey variables</i>, are often only referenced ambiguously. 
        For example, a survey variable may be referenced in many different ways. Below we only list four types of references (please see the <a href="https://github.com/vadis-project/shared-task/" class="text-decoration-none">annotation guideline v1</a> for more examples).

        For this shared task, we focus on concepts specific to social science literature, namely survey variables. We build on the original work of [1],
        [2] and propose an evaluation exercise on the task of <b><i>Variable Detection and Linking</i></b>. Survey variable mention
        identification in texts can be seen as a multi-label classification problem: Given a sentence in a document (in
        our case: a scientific publication in the social sciences), and a list of unique variables (from a reference
        vocabulary of survey variables), the task is to classify which variables, if any, are mentioned in each
        sentence.

        This task splits into two sub-tasks:
      </p>


      <p>
        <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">Task 1 - Variable Detection:</strong> identifying whether the
        sentence contains a variable mention or not
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">Task 2 - Variable Disambiguation:</strong> identifying which
        variable from the vocabulary is specifically mentioned in a certain sentence

      <h2 class="mt-4">Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Task 1: </strong>

        The variable detection task is evaluted using a standard F1-macro score.
        You can use the script <a href="https://github.com/vadis-project/sv-ident/blob/main/scripts/evaluate_task2.py">evaluate_task2.py</a> to check the performance of your model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Task 2: </strong>
        
        The variable disambiguation task will be evaluted using metrics commonly used in information retrieval and eXtreme Multi-label text Classification (XMC).
        These include: <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-39940-9_484">Precision@k</a>, <a href="">Recall@k</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-39940-9_486">R-precision</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-39940-9_3032">MAP</a>.
