    <h4 class="mt-4">Overview</h4>
    <div class="column lefter">


      <p>
        Social science literature often use and reference survey datasets. Typically, a survey dataset has hundreds of
        items or questions, called <i>survey variables</i>. Studies may only focus and reference a specific subset of
        these variables.
        While survey datasets that are used in a publication are typically referenced explicitly in-text using a
        bibliographic citation,
        individual survey variables are often only referenced ambiguously (four examples are shown in Table 1; see the
        <a href="https://github.com/vadis-project/sv-ident/" class="text-decoration-none">annotation guideline v1</a>
        for more examples).
        <!-- Furthermore, survey variables in one language may be referenced in a publication of another language. -->
        This lack of explicit linking between individual survey variables and publications limits aggregate analyses and
        makes comparing different studies non-trivial.
        Automatic methods for detecting and linking survey variables can be used to solve this problem.
        Initial baselines show promising results, however, challenges remain.
        <!-- such as the availability of datasets and the growing number of variables. -->
        <!-- To this end, we present a new dataset of survey variable mentions.  -->

        For this shared task, a system should be built that can identify all relevant variables from English and
        German social science publications given a set of variables and sentences (including their contexts).
        The shared task is split into two sub-tasks:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">Task 1 - Variable Detection:</strong> identifying whether a
        sentence contains a variable mention or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">Task 2 - Variable Disambiguation:</strong> identifying which
        variable from a given vocabulary is mentioned in a sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, we release a trial dataset, which contains 1227 instances for English and German survey variable
        mentions.
        Afterwards, we will release the core dataset (see the timeline below for details).
      </p>

      <!-- <h5 class="mt-4">Examples</h5>
      <p>
        In text fragment 1, there are sentences from different social sciences publications. Sentence-1 Authors
        paraphrases a varible, v278, which is shown in the Figure 2 in . In <strong>Task-1</strong>, the sentence 1 is classified as variable
        mentioned (1). On the
        other hand, since there is no variable mention in Sentence-2, it is classified as not variable mentioned(0).
        Sentence-3
        summarizes more than one variable in a single sentence the Allbus variables v274, v275, v276 and v277.
        Therefore, Sentence-3
        is classified as variable mentioned (1).

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Task-2</strong> focuses on sentences which mentions variables, these are Sentence-1 and Sentence-3 in our example. For
        Sentence-1, it is
        expected to find the specific variable, v278, which mentioned in the sentence. If a sentence mentiones more than
        one
        variable, all mentioned variables need to be finded. For example, Sentence-3 can be linked to the Allbus
        variables v274, v275, v276 and v277
        All of them have a common main question Do you have any personal
        contact with foreigners living in Germany? but differ in their respective subquestions, e.g., ...at work?, ...in
        your neighborhood?
        etc.

        Results of more recent public opinion such as the
        Allbus Survey conducted in 2006 show that the majority of Germans continue to reject the idea of generally
        granting dual citizenship(1).
        The policy shift is partly due to steadily declining immigration to Germany(2). Encounters between Germans and
        foreigners can
        take place in different spheres of life, at work, in
        the neighborhood, in the family or in the circle of
        friends and acquaintances. (3)

        <p>
          <strong>Task 1: </strong>

          The variable detection task is evaluted using a standard F1-macro. You can use the evaluation script <a
            href="https://github.com/vadis-project/sv-ident/blob/main/scripts/evaluate_task1.py">evaluate_task1.py</a> to check the

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Task 2: </strong>

          The variable disambiguation task will be evaluted using metrics commonly used in information retrieval and
          multi-label text classification.
          These include: Precision@k, Recall@k, R-precision, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).
          <!-- We will use <a href="https://opennir.net/metrics.html">OpenNIR</a> for R-precision and <a href="https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval">pytrec_eval</a> for the remaining metrics. -->
