    <h4 class="mt-4">Overview</h4>
    <div class="column lefter">


      <p>
        Social sciences literature often use and reference survey dataset. Typically, a survey dataset has hundreds of
        items or questions called
        as <i>survey variables</i>. Social sciences papers only focus
        on specific set of these variables. In order to establish links between
        data and publications on a fine-grained level it is therefore
        necessary to link not only on study name level but also on
        the level of survey variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a survey dataset that is used in a scientific publication is typically referenced explicitly in-text using
        a bibliographic citation (e.g., Author et al.),
        individual survey items or questions, also called <i>survey variables</i>, are often only referenced
        ambiguously.
        For example, a survey variable may be referenced in many different ways. Below we only list four types of
        references (please see the <a href="https://github.com/vadis-project/shared-task/"
          class="text-decoration-none">annotation guideline v1</a> for more examples).

      <p>
        In this task, a set of variables of a particular
        survey and a set sentences from social sciences publications are given and all relevant mentions that refer to
        one
        of
        these variables are expected to be identified. This task splits into two sub-tasks:


      </p>

      <p>
        <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">Task 1 - Variable Detection:</strong> identifying whether the
        sentence contains a variable mention or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">Task 2 - Variable Disambiguation:</strong> identifying which
        variable from the vocabulary is specifically mentioned in a certain sentence.
      </p>
      <h5 class="mt-4">Examples</h5>
      <p>
        In text fragment 1, there are sentences from different social sciences publications. Sentence-1 Authors
        paraphrases a varible, v278, which is shown in the Figure 2 in . In <strong>Task-1</strong>, the sentence 1 is classified as variable
        mentioned (1). On the
        other hand, since there is no variable mention in Sentence-2, it is classified as not variable mentioned(0).
        Sentence-3
        summarizes more than one variable in a single sentence the Allbus variables v274, v275, v276 and v277.
        Therefore, Sentence-3
        is classified as variable mentioned (1).

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Task-2</strong> focuses on sentences which mentions variables, these are Sentence-1 and Sentence-3 in our example. For
        Sentence-1, it is
        expected to find the specific variable, v278, which mentioned in the sentence. If a sentence mentiones more than
        one
        variable, all mentioned variables need to be finded. For example, Sentence-3 can be linked to the Allbus
        variables v274, v275, v276 and v277
        All of them have a common main question Do you have any personal
        contact with foreigners living in Germany? but differ in their respective subquestions, e.g., ...at work?, ...in
        your neighborhood?
        etc.

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container column side2">

      <p style="background-color:#f2f2f2; font-size: small; padding: 3%;">
        Results of more recent public opinion such as the
        Allbus Survey conducted in 2006 show that the majority of Germans continue to reject the idea of generally
        granting dual citizenship(1).
        The policy shift is partly due to steadily declining immigration to Germany(2). Encounters between Germans and
        foreigners can
        take place in different spheres of life, at work, in
        the neighborhood, in the family or in the circle of
        friends and acquaintances. (3)

        <strong>Task 1: </strong>

        The variable detection task is evaluted using a standard F1-macro.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Task 2: </strong>

        The variable disambiguation task will be evaluted using metrics commonly used in information retrieval and
        eXtreme Multi-label text Classification (XMC).
        These include: Precision@k, Recall@k, R-precision, and MAP.
        <!-- We will use <a href="https://opennir.net/metrics.html">OpenNIR</a> for R-precision and <a href="https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval">pytrec_eval</a> for the remaining metrics. -->
        We use (<a href="https://opennir.net/metrics.html">OpenNIR</a>, <a
          href="https://github.com/terrierteam/ir_measures">ir_measures</a>, <a
          href="https://github.com/joaopalotti/trectools">trectools</a>) to compute all metrics.
      </p>

      You can use the evaluation script (<a href="https://github.com/vadis-project/shared-task">evaluate.py</a>) to
      check the performance of your model on a diverse set of metrics.
